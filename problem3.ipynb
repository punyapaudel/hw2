    "One of fundamental equation in Astronomy, Kepler's equation ($E - e\\sin E = M$) does not have analytical solution. This equation is used to find postion of planet at specific time. In this equation, $E$ is the Eccentric Anomaly: An angle that defines the planet's actual geometric position on its elliptical orbit, $M$ is the Mean Anomaly: A measure of time, proportional to the fraction of the orbital period that has elapsed since the closest approach (periapsis), and $e$ is the Eccentricity: The \"stretch\" of the ellipse ($0 \\le e < 1$)."
